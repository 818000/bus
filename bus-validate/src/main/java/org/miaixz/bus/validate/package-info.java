/**
 * A validator framework that provides annotation-based validation for method parameters and object properties. It
 * intercepts method execution to perform parameter validation beforehand. If validation fails, it can throw custom
 * exceptions and messages. The framework is designed for easy extension with custom validators.
 * <p>
 * This framework was inspired by Hibernate Validator 5.x but is not compatible with it. The decision to create a new
 * framework was made because the annotations provided by JSR-303 are limited and not easily extensible.
