/**
 * An abstract adapter class for the {@link Handler} interface, providing empty default implementations for all methods.
 * <p>
 * This class serves as a convenience for creating custom handlers. Developers can extend this class and override only
 * the methods they are interested in, without being forced to implement every method from the {@code Handler}
 * interface. This is useful for creating simple interceptors that only need to act at one specific stage of the request
 * lifecycle (e.g., only in {@code preHandle}).
