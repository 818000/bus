/**
 * Marks an element (such as a field, parameter, or method) to be explicitly included in a specific processing flow.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is the semantic opposite of {@code @Ignore}. In many frameworks or tools, a "default-exclude" or
 * "include-on-demand" strategy might be in place. In such cases, {@code @Include} is used to specify which elements
 * should be processed, thereby overriding the default behavior.
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation is retained at runtime ({@link RetentionPolicy#RUNTIME}) so that it can be read via reflection by
 * frameworks, libraries, or tools to implement dynamic, annotation-based inclusion logic. Common use cases include:
