 * <p>
 * A DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) is used to construct a tree from a set of keywords. The text is then traversed
 * through this tree to efficiently detect the presence of these keywords. Once the keyword tree is built, searching
 * within the text can be done with O(n) complexity, where n is the length of the text.
