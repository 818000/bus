/**
 * Marks a component to be managed as a singleton, ensuring that only one instance of the class is created and reused
 * for all injection requests within a given container or scope.
 * <p>
 * When applied to a class or a factory method (e.g., a {@code @Bean} method), it instructs the dependency injection
 * framework to maintain a single, shared instance of the component. This is the default scope in many DI frameworks but
 * can be made explicit for clarity.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is itself annotated with {@link Scope}, identifying it as a scope-defining annotation.
