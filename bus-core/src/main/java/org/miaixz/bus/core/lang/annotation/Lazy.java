/**
 * Indicates that a component, such as a singleton bean, should be initialized lazily.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can be applied to a class to signal that it should not be instantiated at application startup but
 * rather on its first access. It can also be used on methods, particularly factory methods (e.g., those annotated with
 * {@code @Bean} in a configuration class), to indicate that the bean they define should be created lazily.
 * <p>
 * Lazy initialization is beneficial for improving application startup performance by deferring the creation of
 * resource-intensive or infrequently used components. It can also be used as a strategy to break circular dependencies
 * between beans.
