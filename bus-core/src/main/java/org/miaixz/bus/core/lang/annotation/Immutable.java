/**
 * A marker annotation that indicates a class or method return type is immutable.
 * <p>
 * An object is considered immutable if its state cannot be modified after it is created. This property is highly
 * valuable in concurrent programming because immutable objects are inherently thread-safe and can be shared freely
 * without the need for locking.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is primarily for documentation purposes and for use by static analysis tools to verify immutability
 * constraints.
